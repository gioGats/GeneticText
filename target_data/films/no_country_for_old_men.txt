FADE EV:
MOUNTAINS NIGHT
Snow is falling in a gusting wind. The voice of an old man:
Voice-Over
I was sheriff of this county when I was twenty-five. Hard
to believe. Grandfather was a lawman. Father too. Me
and him was sheriff at the same time, him in Plano and me
here. I think he was pretty proud of that. I know I was.
We dissolve to another West Texas landscape. Sun is rising.
Some of the old-time sheriffs never even wore a gun. A lot
of folks find that hard to believe. Jim Scarborough never
carried one. That's the younger Jim. Gaston Boykins
wouldn't wear one. Up in Commanche County.

s

Wc dissolve through more landscapes, bringing us to 1 1 1 day. None of them show
people or human habitation.
I always liked to hear about the old-timers. Never missed a
chance to do so. Nigger Hoskins over in Bastrop County
knowed everbody's phone number off by heart. You can't
help but compare yourself against the old timers. Can't
help but wonder how they would've operated these times.
There was this boy I sent to Huntsville here a while back.
My arrest and my testimony. He killed a fourteen-year-old
girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me
there wasn't any passion to it.

The last landscape, hard sunbaked prairie, is surveyed in a long slow pan.
Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody for about
as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him
out he'd do it again.
The pan has brought into frame the flashing lightbars of a police car stopped on the
shoulder. A young sheriffs deputy is opening the rear door on the far side of the car.
Said he knew he was going to hell. Be there in about fifteen

minutes. I don't know what to make of that. I surely don't.
